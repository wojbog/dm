    "### What is the Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a computing platform that is very commonly used for code presentation, on-hand code execution, as well as preparing code snippets, which later on might be used in a larger library. In this setting you can easily combine Markdown text and executable Python code. This format is very popular in machine learning, data mining and artificial intelligence field in general. A single file in this setting is very often referred to as just a *Notebook*. The file you are viewing right now is a Notebook. Notebook files are usually named with the extension *.ipynb*, which stems from the original open-source project name *IPython Notebook*. The Notebook uses an interactive kernel,  which allows us to maintain the current execution of the code. During the execution, all variables, defined functions, and classes, etc. are stored in the memory, which gives us flexible access to everything we coded (this is nothing new compared to a standard Python interpreter). The Notebooks are delivered to us in several different settings, here are some:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Advanced, modern IDE, which supports Jupyter Notebooks.** In this setting, the IDE is responsible for setting up the interactive kernel with the use of the Python interpreter. A good example of an IDE, which supports the Jupyter Notebooks is Visual Studio Code. Prior to using this option, we need to set up the Python interpreter on the machine.\n",
    "  \n",
    "      **Pros**:\n",
    "\n",
    "         * full customization\n",
    "         * full access to data on hand\n",
    "         * usually supports version control\n",
    "         * easy setup process\n",
    "      **Cons**:\n",
    "      \n",
    "         * you need to set up an IDE on every machine you work on\n",
    "         * requires installation of Python interpreter on the machine\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **A stand-alone Jupyter Notebook server.** This is the original method of delivering the Notebooks. In order to use this setting, one must download and run the Jupyter Server as a separate process on a machine on hand. The Jupyter Notebook server often comes in bundle with complete Python distributions (e.g. WinPython), in that case, the server executable file is usually within the Python folder. The Jupyter Notebook server allows us to access, view and run the notebooks via the web application accessible through a browser. The server allows us to set up the connection details (e.g. the IP address, port, authentication method, password). If you want to use the server in a public network. you need to be very careful while using this option, as it allows an easy access to the Remote Code Execution, which is a substantial vulnerability. Whoever has the access to the *Notebooks* via the server, essentially has the same privileges, as the user, who started the server. Nothing stops us from using the server on the *localhost*. Running the server in a default setting is as simple as running the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "                 jupyter notebook\n",
    "  \n",
    "      Once the server is running, you have access to files and directories, starting with the directory on which, the server was started. Opening the notebook file, switches the application view, so that you can execute the code and read the markdown.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      **Pros**:\n",
    "\n",
    "         * full customization\n",
    "         * access to data on the server machine\n",
    "         * ability to use it in a network setting with many users and a single server\n",
    "      **Cons**:\n",
    "      \n",
    "         * fairly hard setup process (if you want to use it with several users in a network setting)\n",
    "         * if you do not have a server machine, you can only run it in an offline setting\n",
    "         * no native support for version control\n",
    "         * requires installation of Python interpreter on the machine\n",
    "          \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **External Notebook server paired up with virtual machine.** In this setting, we are using a virtual machine with a temporary python environment as the working space. Although we are not forced to maintain the Notebook server, this option comes with several limitations. We are forced to follow the rules of the virtual machine provider. Usually we not permitted to use such a notebook in order to host data, download torrents, use it as an SSH server, connect to the remote proxy, etc. (nothing really related to Data Mining). Such a notebook does not have direct access to our files, we usually need to upload the data on the virtual machine (or a cloud drive) in order to process the data. Other than that, we can consume the Nootebook files as normal. A good example of this setting is Google Colaboratory.\n",

Then, you open the Visual Studio Code application and from the File menu you choose the Open Directory option. In the file explorer you should be able to see this notebook.

    "### How is a Notebook organized?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Notebook consists of list of cells. There are two types of cells:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Code cell** - the code cell is filled with the code in the programming language the Notebook is set up for (usually it's Python). You can execute the code and immediately see the result. Everything that *happened* in the execution is available in the next cell you run. Once the code cell is executed, it is annotated with a number, which refers to the order of execution. The first cell you run will be annotated with number [1], second with number [2], etc. The enumeration helps us to keep up with the current status of execution.\n",
    " - **Markdown cell** - the markdown cell allows us to insert a formatted text into the notebook. The text is formatted with use of the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) language. The Markdown is a lightweight markup language, which is used to add simple formatting to plaintext documents. It was created in 2004 by John Gruber. It is one of the most popular markup languages. This is the same language you can use for example in the Discord app.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    " Each of the code cells can be executed at any point. In most of the IDEs we are allowed to run all cells at once, restart the interpreter and clear all variables and definitions, add a new cell, and reorder existing the cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " #### Exercise 1. \n",
    " \n",
    " Execute the cells in the following order:\n",
    "   1. Run cell 2\n",
